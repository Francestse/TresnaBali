      <h2>Why Tresna Bali?</h2>

      <p>
        With us, you won’t just visit the place we love — you’ll step directly into it.
        Into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens, and our Balinese
        way of life — taking your place around our welcoming table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tresna means “love” in Balinese, and it is what we poured into building
        our purpose-built cooking school from the ground up. We are not an
        afterthought at a hotel, nor a temporary setup in someone’s compound.
        This is a dedicated space created intentionally for sharing our culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hosted by Balinese temple priest Adi and priestess Frances Ardika, our
        classes go beyond recipes. You will pick organic ingredients from our
        riverside garden, prepare traditional spice pastes by hand, and cook dishes
        rooted in daily ritual, ceremony, and family life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, your hands do the work. You cook. You taste. You learn.
        And you leave with more than a full stomach — you leave with a deeper
        understanding of Balinese culture.
      </p>
