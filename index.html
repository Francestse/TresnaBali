<!-- Why Tresna Bali? -->

    <h2>Why Tresna Bali?</h2>
    <p>
      With us, you won’t just see the place we love, you’ll barrel into it –
      into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese
      way of life – taking your own special place around our welcoming table.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we poured into the building
      of our dream cooking school. It would be a mistake to see us as "just
      another cooking class". We're not an afterthought at a hotel or a table
      set up in someone’s family compound.
    </p>

    <h3>
      We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking school on its head, building
      it from the ground up.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Sure, you’ll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond
      full, but you’ll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture, pick
      your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking, experiencing
      each intriguing element of everything you’ll put in your mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      With our shared love of food and cooking, you'll delve into hands-on
      lessons that feature your hands, not ours.
