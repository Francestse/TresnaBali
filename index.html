    <h2>Why Tresna Bali?</h2>
    <p>
      With us, you won’t just see the place we love, you’ll barrel into it –
      into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese
      way of life – taking your own special place around our welcoming table.
    </p>
    <p>Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we poured into the building of our dream cooking school. It would be a mistake to see us as "just another cooking class". We're not an afterthought at a hotel or a table set up in someone’s family compound.
    </p>

    <h3>We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking school on its head, building it from ground up.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Sure, you’ll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond
     full, but you’ll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture,
      pick your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking,
      experiencing each intriguing element of everything you’ll put in your
      mouth.
    </p>

    <p>With our shared love of food and cooking, you'll delve into hands-on lessons that feature your hands, not ours.
    </p>

      <p>We were blown away when Anh Luu from the famous blog, Girl and The Word, stepped through the doors of our wooden gate. I recognized her immediately as I had been following her on Instagram for over a year.  Her boyfriend, Jon had booked our cooking class on Airbnb Experiences so it wasn’t even Anh who had planned to come. Anh surprised us 2 weeks later with a 10-page Blog and Instagram story about Tresna Bali Cooking School. We’re so grateful for this outpouring of love and support. Tresna Bali is truly built on love.<br><a href="https://www.girlandtheword.com/bali/the-best-balinese-cooking-class-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for her amazing photos and story of her experience here.</a></p>

      <p><span class="post-title">An Authentic Balinese Feast at Tresna Bali Cooking School</span><br><span class="post-subtitle">By Passport To Wellness, Brittney Ayers</span></p>
      <p>In early 2019, Brittney booked for a May class.  We accommodated a date change to August since she informed us months in advance. Meanwhile, participants were telling us that they preferred a smaller class size and were willing to pay more. We tested a smaller class size - from 12 participants to 6 - doubling the price for each participant. Brittney was a bit put out by the price increase not knowing we have only 2 classes per week because it takes a full day to prep for each class. We settled on a class of 8 with a discounted prepaid rate of USD 75 per person.<br><a href="https://passporttowellness.co/blog/preparing-an-authentic-balinese-feast-at-tresna-bali-cooking-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read Brittney's blog and why she now feels our cooking school is an amazing value!</a></p>

      <p><span class="post-title">A Unique Cooking School Experience at Tresna Bali</span><br><span class="post-subtitle">By We Are Travel Girls, Becky van Dijk</span></p>
      <p>I went to We Are Travel Girls First Bali Meet-Up in 2016. There I met Becky, the amazing founder of “We Are Travel Girls”. Becky and her boyfriend, Ryan had recently moved to Bali. We got to know each other better when we all took an Immersive Coding Retreat. That's where I learned to code the very wesbite you're looking at! The time away ignited Becky’s imagination to create luxury retreats for her community of adventurous women. Becky chose our cooking class as one of the highlights for her Luxury Bali Retreats.<br><a href="https://wearetravelgirls.com/tresna-bali-cooking-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read about their experience here.</a></p>
