      <p>
        With us, you won't just see the place we love, you'll barrel into it -
        into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese
        way of life - taking your own special place around our welcoming table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, you'll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond
        full, but you'll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture, pick
        your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking,
        experiencing each intriguing element of everything you'll put in your
        mouth.
