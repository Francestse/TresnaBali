    <h3>Why Tresna Bali?</h3>
    <p>
      With us, you won't just see the place we love, you'll barrel into it -
      into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese
      way of life - taking your own special place around our welcoming table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure, you'll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond
      full, but you'll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture, pick
      your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking, experiencing
      each intriguing element of everything you'll put in your mouth.
