        <h2>The Experience</h2>
        <p>
          We host a maximum of 3 classes per week and only 8 participants per class because of our duties as Priest and Priestess at temple. And because our team of 5 prep cooks prepares in advance for an entire day for each class.</p>

        <h3>Our class menus are a celebration of fresh and unique ingredients of the season and that day which you won't find anywhere else in Bali.
        </h3>

        <p>You'll learn recipes found only in a traditional Balinese family compound where the head of the house is a passionate gardener and cook. Adi will teach you his step-by-step recipes that he’s honed over 3 decades. You’ll be immersed in a hands-on cooking class, learning 15 step-by-step recipes authentic Balinese recipes, not found anywhere else. You'll get an "inside" view of real Balinese life – learning the secrets of Balinese ceremonies and the special role of food in temple offerings.
