My wife and I absolutely loved our experience with Tresna Bali Cooking School! Frances and Adi have a passion for sharing their love of traditional Balinese food. Their property is beautiful and teeming with fresh ingredients that are harvested and used in the cooking class. Frances and Adi’s knowledge of the plants coupled with Adi’s personal stories about growing up cooking made for a special day that can’t be found many places. The kitchen and facilities are clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. We felt like we were in a large home kitchen. The recipes were approachable for the home cook but felt elevated by the freshness and variety of ingredients. Sharing the delicious meal and conversation with Frances and Adi capped off our amazing day. Everything about this cooking class exceeded our expectations. Don’t look anywhere else for a cooking experience in Bali; Tresna Bali Cooking School has it all!
