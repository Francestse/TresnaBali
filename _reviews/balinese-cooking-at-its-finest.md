I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the day spent with Adi, Frances and the team at Tresna Cooking School. Smiles, laughs and the best food of the holiday all wrapped into one!

Firstly we were met by Adi as he picked us up to take us to the school, which is beautifully located with well stocked gardens. On arrival, we met Frances and the team who were all so friendly and smiling. &nbsp;A chance then to roam the well stocked herb and spice garden to pick some fresh produce to cook with. Adi & Frances really know what they are going!&nbsp;

We were then took through a number of recipes with Adi to create a banquet for lunch! And when they say feast I mean itâ€™s a feast!&nbsp;

I would advise anyone looking to learn Balinese cuisine to book with these guys, they are superb!!&nbsp;

May have to come back when next in Bali!! &nbsp;Until next time.
