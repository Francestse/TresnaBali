Francis and Adi have created a beautiful modern fully equiped kitchen purpose built for a cooking school. I wish my kitchen looked so good. We strolled through their garden, learning about and collecting herbs for our recipes. We each had our own work station and prepped much of the food for our lunch. Adi has a lovely sense of humour and we enjoyed learning about Balinese ceremonial custom . We created 9 dishes and each was delicious. A wonderful experience .
