WOW! I can’t imagine something like this exists in Bali!  Once we arrived at Tresna, we were floored by the amazing design of the kitchen and their beautiful garden. Frances and Adi started off the day by showing us around their garden where we picked some herbs and vegetable. <br><br>We were lucky enough to be in a small group of 4 guests so we were able to chat away and try out so many different cooking and mixing techniques. I’ve been to Bali many times and I’ve never had food as fresh as what they offered. We had a feast! <br><br>My best friend also had an amazing experience learning about Balinese cuisine from Adi and Frances who was very passionate about design and cooking. Would love to do this again when I’m back in town!
