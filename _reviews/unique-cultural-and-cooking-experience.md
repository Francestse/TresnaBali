Tresna Bali cooking school delivered a unique Balinese cultural experience in a beautiful sleek modern kitchen. Traditional recipes and natural ingredients from the garden surrounding the kitchen gave us the opportunity to learn traditional Balinese dishes while hearing fascinating stories of the local community and their participation in ceremonies. Frances and Adi are a providing a truly authentic and fun Bali experience. We love our day there and at the end had a huge sumptuous feast. Highly recommended.
