So glad we decided to book a class with Adi and Frances. We had a wonderful morning walking through their expansive garden picking and smelling ingredients and learning about the different uses and stories associated with each one. You can tell how much love goes into Adi and Frances’ cooking by how passionate they are about growing their own foods.&nbsp;

Adi was fantastic stepping us through the process of each dish, explaining ingredients and alternatives we could use back home if we can’t find the exact same. We are looking forward to replicating some of these recipes soon.<br>Very good balance between involvement in cooking and assistance from staff, perfect for any level of cooking skill, Adi was good at accommodating for skill level of each group member and teaching where he could. Traditional food and cooking methods made even more enjoyable by stories of the importance of food in Balinese culture.&nbsp;<br>We made nine dishes in total and had a wonderful feast. Do not recommend having a big brekky before hand!<br>Both Adi and Frances were friendly, welcoming and with good wit. We had more than a few laughs in their beautiful kitchen which was perfectly designed to accommodate an intimate cooking feel.<br>Thank you Adi and Frances for a beautiful day, we couldn’t have thought of a better way to experience true Balinese food and celebrate our anniversary.
