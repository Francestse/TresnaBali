I couldn’t be happier that my boyfriend and I decided to come to Tresna for our cooking class in Bali. This was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. Frances and Adi couldn’t have been more enjoyable and knowledgeable. They have a great team, a stunning kitchen and delicious recipes. My only regret is that we didn’t stay at their guesthouse during our stay in Ubud, it looked like an absolute dream.
