My new husband and I had the BEST time at Tresna Bali Cooking School during our honeymoon. From the very beginning, Frances was super responsive and helpful and booking our class via e-mail exchange was a breeze. The morning of, we met Adi right where he told us he would be (and on time!) and off we went to their compound. This was a truly comprehensive experience, one in which we were able to navigate their on-property gardens as Adi and Frances explained in detail what each plant (herbs, vegetables) was, what it's typically used for, and how we would be utilizing it in class. The cooking experience itself was very hands-on, and we were able to fully participate, taste and cook each dish in some capacity. It was truly amazing and whenever anyone asks us how our honeymoon was, this is the first activity that we love to share! Thanks Adi & Frances for an AMAZING time!
