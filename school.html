      <h2 class="center">Our Cooking School</h2>
      <p class="center">We found our little piece of paradise in 2009 - lush riverside land just outside of Ubud that was pure virgin jungle. We envisioned and created a purpose-built cooking school nestled amoung the towering coconut trees and mature tropical fruit trees such as durian, jackfruit, and rambutan.</p>
      <p> As the daughter of an architect, Frances custom-designed every last detail of the school – reclaimed ironwood workbenches, Italian Patina cupboards, stainless steel counters, teak dining chairs, handmade ceramics, white washed cement walls, and brass lamps – down to each doorknob - everything is unique to our school.</p>
      <p>Adi planted our organic gardens where you pick your own ingredients. He chose every tool in the kitchen: razor-sharp chef knives, dedicated cutting boards, and volcanic rock mortar and pestles.</p>
