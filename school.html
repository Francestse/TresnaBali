      <h2 class="center">Our Riverside Garden</h2>
      <p class="center">We found our little piece of paradise in 2009 - lush riverside land just outside of Ubud that was pure virgin jungle. We envisioned and created a purpose-built cooking school nestled among the towering coconut trees and mature tropical fruit trees such as durian, jackfruit, and rambutan.</p>
      <p>Adi spends each day tending to his organic gardens where you pick your own ingredients. He'll introduce you to unique Balinese fruits, spices, and vegetables to be used minutes after you harvest them!</p>
      <p>We reassembled an antique little wooden cottage where you can stay in Adi's magical garden. Because it was almost always sold out, Adi built another luxurious teak wood cabin with spectacular river views.

      <p class="center margin-top-0">As the daughter of an architect, Frances custom-designed every last detail of the cooking school kitchen – reclaimed ironwood workbenches, Italian Patina cupboards, stainless steel counters, teak dining chairs, handmade ceramics, white washed cement walls, and brass lamps – down to each doorknob - everything is unique to our school. </p>
      <p class="center margin-top-0">Adi chose every tool in the kitchen: razor-sharp chef knives, dedicated cutting boards, and volcanic rock mortar and pestles. Our 'Masterchef' kitchen has been designed as live theatre stations where you're one of the main actors!</p>

        <h2>Our Immersive and Exclusive Experience</h2>
        <p>
          We host a maximum of 3 classes per week and only 8 participants per class because of our duties as Priest and Priestess at temple. And because our team of 5 prep cooks prepares in advance for an entire day for each class.</p>

        <h3>You'll get an "inside" view of real Balinese life – learning the secrets of Balinese ceremonies and the special role of food in temple offerings.</h3>

        <p>Adi will teach you his step-by-step recipes, not found anywhere else, that he’s honed over 3 decades. You'll learn recipes mastered in a traditional Balinese family compound where the head of the house is a passionate gardener and cook.</p>
