      <h2 class="center">Our Cooking School</h2>
      <p class="center">We found our little piece of paradise in 2009 - lush riverside land just outside of Ubud that was pure virgin jungle. We envisioned and created a purpose-built cooking school nestled amoung the towering coconut trees and mature tropical fruit trees such as durian, jackfruit, and rambutan.</p>
      <p> As the daughter of an architect, Frances custom-designed every last detail of the school – reclaimed ironwood workbenches, Italian Patina cupboards, stainless steel counters, teak dining chairs, handmade ceramics, white washed cement walls, and brass lamps – down to each doorknob - everything is unique to our school.</p>
      <p>Adi planted our organic gardens where you pick your own ingredients. He chose every tool in the kitchen: razor-sharp chef knives, dedicated cutting boards, and volcanic rock mortar and pestles.</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We started as a love story 22 years ago.  Frances Tse Ardika, born Canadian and having lived in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, Tokyo and Toronto as well as having traveled extensively throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas, finally found her paradise and home when she met her Balinese husband, I Made Adi Ardika. Together, they seek the next big food adventure and discover the foods of their beloved island with friends from near and far..
        </p>
        <p>Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we poured into the building of our dream cooking school. It would be a mistake to see us as "just another cooking class". We're not an afterthought at a hotel or a table set up in someone’s family compound.
        </p>

        <h3>We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking school on its head, building it from ground up.
        </h3>

        <p>
          Sure, you’ll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond full, but you’ll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture,
          pick your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking, experiencing each intriguing element of everything you’ll put in your
          mouth.
        </p>

        <p>With our shared love of food and cooking, you'll delve into hands-on lessons that feature your hands, not ours.
        </p>
