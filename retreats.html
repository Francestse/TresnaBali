      Looking for a gastronomical retreat where you are immersed in the
      mysticism of Balinese culture?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our culinary and cultural retreat is reserved for only 12 participants to
      bask in a luxurious villa where your every need is taken care of by our
      resident experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll gain an inside perspective of Bali’s sacred culture through magical
      experiences, curated personally by our Resident Balinese Holyperson
      (Priestess) and Wedding Organizer, <a href="/about">Frances Tse Ardika</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances has eaten in thousands of roadside warungs as well as created the
      most sumptious wedding feasts with the top Chefs in Bali over 19 years
      before building an authentic cooking school from ground up. She has spent
      a lot of time praying in Temples across the island, as she became Bali’s
      only Holyperson from outside of Bali.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, she’ll share her personal journey with you from when
      she first set foot in this Paradise on October 7, 2000. 19 years later,
      she owns 5 enterprising small businesses all revolving around her passions
      of food, culture, healing and spirituality.

    <h3>Providing you with authentic Balinese experiences.</h3>
    <p>
      Without a doubt, Bali is beautiful. However, most people who visit the
      island miss an opportunity to discover real Balinese Culture. With
      Frances’ deep insights and real Balinese life, you’ll experience a Bali
      that is rarely shared with visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you have been to Bali 20 times before, with this unique retreat,
      you’ll experience authentic local flavours, traverse the natural
      landscape, and embrace what it means to be truly Balinese.
