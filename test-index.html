    <h2>Why Tresna Bali?</h2>
    
    <p>
      With us, you won’t just see the place we love, you’ll barrel into it –
      into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese
      way of life – taking your own special place around our welcoming table.
    </p>
    <p>Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we poured into the building of our dream cooking school. It would be a mistake to see us as "just another cooking class". We're not an afterthought at a hotel or a table set up in someone’s family compound.
    </p>
    
    <h2>We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking class on its head, building it from ground up.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Sure, you’ll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond
     full, but you’ll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture,
      pick your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking,
      experiencing each intriguing element of everything you’ll put in your
      mouth.
    </p>
    
    <p>With our shared love of food and cooking, you'll delve into hands-on lessons that feature your hands, not ours.

        <p>We were blown away when Anh Luu from the famous blog, Girl and The Word, stepped through the doors of our wooden gate.  I recognized her immediately as I had been following her on Instagram for over a year.  Her boyfriend, Jon had booked our cooking class on Airbnb Experiences so it wasn’t even Anh who had planned to come.   Anh surprised us 2 weeks later with a 10-page Blog and Instagram story about Tresna Bali Cooking School.  We’re so grateful for this outpouring of love and support.  Tresna Bali is truly built on love.<br><a href="https://www.girlandtheword.com/bali/the-best-balinese-cooking-class-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for her amazing photos and story of her experience here.</a></p>

        <p>In early March, Brittney booked for a May class.  We accommodated a date change to August since she informed us months in advance.  Meanwhile, participants were telling us that they preferred a smaller class size and were willing to pay more.  In June, we tested a new class format - from 12 participants to 6 - essentially doubling the price for each participant.  Brittney was a bit put out by the increase in price, but she didn’t understand at that time why we only have 4 classes per week.  It takes a full day to prep for each class.  After our test finding, we decided on a Class of 9 at USD 70 per person.<br><a href="https://passporttowellness.co/blog/preparing-an-authentic-balinese-feast-at-tresna-bali-cooking-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read why Brittney is now one of our biggest supporters and why she now feels our cooking school is an amazing value!</a></p>

        <p>I went to We Are Travel Girls First Bali Meet-Up in 2016.  There I met Becky, the amazing founder of “We Are Travel Girls”.  Becky and her boyfriend, Ryan had recently moved to Bali.   We got to know each other better as we all took an Immersive Coding Retreat where we felt things could be done better.  That ignited Becky’s imagination to create luxury retreats for her community of adventurous women.  Becky chose our cooking class as one of the highlights for her Luxury Bali Retreats.<br><a href="https://wearetravelgirls.com/tresna-bali-cooking-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read about their experience here.</a></p>
