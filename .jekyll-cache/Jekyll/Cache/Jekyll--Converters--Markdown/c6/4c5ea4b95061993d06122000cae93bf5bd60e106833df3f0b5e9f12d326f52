I"¤<p>I couldnâ€™t be happier that my boyfriend and I decided to come to Tresna for our cooking class in Bali. This was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. Frances and Adi couldnâ€™t have been more enjoyable and knowledgeable. They have a great team, a stunning kitchen and delicious recipes. My only regret is that we didnâ€™t stay at their guesthouse during our stay in Ubud, it looked like an absolute dream.</p>
