I"š<p>My husband and I loved the Tresna Bali Cooking School. We were staying in Ubud so received the free transfers - Frances picked us up on time. The classes are kept small with a maximum of 10 which means you can always see what is going on.</p>

<p>The class started with a refreshing welcome drink and garden tour to see and pick some of the ingredients we would be using. We were able to be involved in the process which was great - rather than just watching someone else cook the whole time. There was also a bit of tasting as we went along and then we all sat down to enjoy the dishes cooked - there was plenty of food and it was all delicious!</p>

<p>Adi and Frances were very generous in answering questions and talking about Balinese life and culture. All the recipes were emailed to us after the class. It would be suitable for couples, families with teens, friends or solos. I would definitely do it again.</p>
