I"…<p>While staying at the cooking schoolâ€™s beautiful Little Wooden Cottage, we partook in a cooking school class of traditional Balinese cuisine.</p>

<p>To start, Adi and Frances walked us through their charming garden (trees and plants are named with friends and family) to pick the fresh ingredients, while always explaining the spices and the roles they serve in our upcoming dishes.</p>

<p>Together, they took us through the preparations of each dish with expertise and gusto! From the techniques of chopping and cooking, to the insight of the ingredients, the course had it all. Afterwards you sit down and enjoy the extraordinary dishes!</p>

<p>Whether youâ€™re a chef or a novice cook, youâ€™re sure to learn something here about Balinese culture and cooking, and more importantly - have a lot of fun while at it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Adi and Frances for the amazing culinarily experience!</p>
