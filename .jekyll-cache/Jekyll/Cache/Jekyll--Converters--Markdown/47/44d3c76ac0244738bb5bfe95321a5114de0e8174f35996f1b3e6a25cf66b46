I"<p>Wow – what a cooking school!</p>

<p>Frances and Adi have created a GEM of a cooking school in Ubud. From their amazing garden and surrounds where you pick fresh vegetables and herbs, the well-organised and clean kitchen, the small class size of no more than 10 people – you really do have a great experience at Tresna cooking School.</p>

<p>My husband and I learnt so much during the class, for the rest of our Bali trip we knew exactly what the traditional foods, flavours and quality were – particularly the banana green crepes – the best we had was at Tresna!</p>

<p>There is a real sense of pride and passion for traditional Indonesian cooking. Most of all, Frances and Adi love what they do – and you can see this at Tresna Bali Cooking School. A must do while in Ubud/Bali</p>
