I"x<p>Adi and Frances are not just great chefs, they are good people. It is a real blessing when someone lets you into their kitchen with open arms and teach you culture, topped off with good quality cooking.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this class for enthusiasts or even seasoned chefs. So much knowledge to tap into in a short course that Iâ€™ll be going back for round 2!!</p>
